* Un-hardcode DEBIAN_VERSION from generate.py. Instead, fetch from
  some .debian.org URL.

* Major refactoring/code clean-up still required.

* Move per-year filtering logic out of the Makefile and into the
  python code itself, so we parse wml/data and JSON only once instead
  of as many times as we have years.
